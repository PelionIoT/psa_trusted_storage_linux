 * may be transient or permanent depending on the cause.
 *
 * \warning If a function returns this error, it is undetermined
 * whether the requested action has completed or not. Implementations
 * should return #PSA_SUCCESS on successful completion whenver
 * possible, however functions may return #PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
 * if the requested action was completed successfully in an external

/** There was a storage failure that may have led to data loss.

 * (use #PSA_ERROR_TAMPERING_DETECTED), for a communication error
 * between the cryptoprocessor and its external storage (use
 * #PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE), or when the storage is
 * in a valid state but is full (use #PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE).
 *
 * Note that a storage failure does not indicate that any data that was
 * previously read is invalid. However this previously read data may no
 * longer be readable from storage.
 *
 * When a storage failure occurs, it is no longer possible to ensure
 * the global integrity of the keystore. Depending on the global
 * integrity guarantees offered by the implementation, access to other
 * data may or may not fail even if the data is still readable but
 * its integrity canont be guaranteed.
 *
 * Implementations should only use this error code to report a
 * permanent storage corruption. However application writers should
 * keep in mind that transient errors while reading the storage may be
 * reported using this error code. */

 * If an application receives this error code, there is no guarantee
 * that previously accessed or computed data was correct and remains
 * confidential. Applications should not perform any security function
 * and should enter a safe failure state.
 *
 * Implementations may return this error code if they detect an invalid
 * state that cannot happen during normal operation and that indicates
 * that the implementation's security guarantees no longer hold. Depending
 * on the implementation architecture and on its security and safety goals,
 * the implementation may forcibly terminate the application.
 *
 * This error code is intended as a last resort when a security breach
 * is detected and it is unsure whether the keystore data is still
 * protected. Implementations shall only return this error code
 * to report an alarm from a tampering detector, to indicate that
 * the confidentiality of stored data can no longer be guaranteed,
 * or to indicate that the integrity of previously returned data is now
 * considered compromised. Implementations shall not use this error code
 * to indicate a hardware failure that merely makes it impossible to
 * perform the requested operation (use #PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE,
 * #PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE, #PSA_ERROR_HARDWARE_FAILURE,
 * #PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_ENTROPY or other applicable error code
 * instead).
 *
 * This error indicates an attack against the application. Implementations
 * shall not return this error code as a consequence of the behavior of
 * the application itself. */

/** There is not enough entropy to generate random data needed

 * This error indicates a failure of a hardware random generator.
 * Application writers should note that this error can be returned not
 * only by functions whose purpose is to generate random data, such
 * as key, IV or nonce generation, but also by functions that execute
 * an algorithm with a randomized result, as well as functions that
 * use randomization of intermediate computations as a countermeasure
 * to certain attacks.
 *
 * Implementations should avoid returning this error after psa_crypto_init()
 * has succeeded. Implementations should generate sufficient
 * entropy during initialization and subsequently use a cryptographically
 * secure pseudorandom generator (PRNG). However implementations may return
 * this error at any time if a policy requires the PRNG to be reseeded
 * during normal operation. */

/** The decrypted padding is incorrect.
 *
 * \warning In some protocols, when decrypting data, it is essential that
 * the behavior of the application does not depend on whether the padding
 * is correct, down to precise timing. Applications should prefer
 * protocols that use authenticated encryption rather than plain
 * encryption. If the application must perform a decryption of
 * unauthenticated data, the application writer should take care not
 * to reveal whether the padding is invalid.
 *
 * Implementations should strive to make valid and invalid padding
 * as close as possible to indistinguishable to an external observer.
